          I have used Ahmad Milzam web design services to come out
          with a new design for an existing web site and to create a
          new web site for my consulting activities.
          As a programmer, I have always struggled with proper design
          and layout and Ahmad Milzam brought me always the right solution.
          [...]
          <!-- The cooperation with him allowed me also to discover the area
          of programming that I needed to improve for a dynamic and
          responsive web site.
          I am actually using his services since the beginning of April 2014
          and even though, our cooperation is still ongoing, -->
          I am proud to write this testimonial for him
          to acknowledge his talent, knowledge and great work so far.
